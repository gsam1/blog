# Hey guys

This is not my first time trying to blog, I even made a simple static site generator a while back ([still located here](https://github.com/gsam1/mark-blog-js)) with Vue and Webpack, but since I don't do Javascript anymore, and I do a ton of jupyter notebooks I thought moving my blog onto fastpages will be more in sync with my day-to-day workflow.

In any case - who am I?  
I am Georgi, currently a Data Scientist at DXC, lending a hand to the automotive industry to build its self-driving cars. My interests, besides the obvious focus on the Data Science - Machine Learning related also include various other tools from DevOps and Web Development. So you can expect topics around that.

Cheers.
