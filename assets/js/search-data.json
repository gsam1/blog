This is not my first time trying to blog, I even made a simple static site generator a while back (still located here) with Vue and Webpack, but since I don’t do Javascript anymore, and I do a ton of jupyter notebooks I thought moving my blog onto fastpages will be more in sync with my day-to-day workflow. . In any case - who am I? I am Georgi, currently a Data Scientist at DXC, lending a hand to the automotive industry to build its self-driving cars. My interests, besides the obvious focus on the Data Science - Machine Learning related also include various other tools from DevOps and Web Development. So you can expect topics around that. . Cheers. .",
